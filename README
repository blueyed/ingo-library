DESCRIPTION
This library contains common autoload functions that are used by almost all of
my plugins (http://www.vim.org/account/profile.php?user_id=9713). Instead of
duplicating the functionality, or installing potentially conflicting versions
with each plugin, this one core dependency fosters a lean Vim runtime and
easier plugin updates.

RELATED WORKS
Other authors have published separate support libraries, too:

- genutils (vimscript #197) by Hari Krishna Dara
- lh-vim-lib (vimscript #214) by Luc Hermitte
- cecutil (vimscript #1066) by DrChip
- tlib (vimscript #1863) by Thomas Link
- TOVL (vimscript #1963) by Marc Weber
- l9 (vimscript #3252) by Takeshi Nishida
- anwolib (vimscript #3800) by Andy Wokula
- vim-misc (vimscript #4597) by Peter Odding

There have been initiatives to gather and consolidate useful functions into a
"standard Vim library", but these efforts have mostly fizzled out.
